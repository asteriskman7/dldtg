              Welcome to Digital Logic Design <small>(The Game)</small>! This game combines elements
              of traditional incremental games like Cookie Clicker with more complex elements designed
              apeal to someone interested in clicking less and thinking more.
            </p>
            <p class='p_narrow'>
              In this game you will take on the role of a digital logic designer. You will be presented
              with designs you must implement using logic gates. The design will be simulated to
              verify that your implementation fulfills the requirements. Then you will be able to sell your design
              to generate cash to purchase upgrades and additional designs.
            </p>
            <p class='p_narrow'>
              However, there are 2 complications.
            </p>
            <p class='p_narrow'>
              First, you only have one logical primitive available to you, the NAND gate. If you need
              something else, an OR gate for example, you will have to design it yourself using NAND gates.
              In fact, many of the first designs available to work on will be other simple logic gates.
            </p>
            <p class='p_narrow'>
              Second, you can't create NAND gates from thin air. NAND gates are built from silicon (Si).
              In order to sell your designs you must have enough silicon to create all the NAND gates required
              for that design. The number of NAND gates required is defined by your own design implementation so
              try to minimize the number of NANDs you use. Silicon is collected via mining, a task you will be performing
              frequently at first but perhaps less often as you are able to purchase upgrades.
            </p>
            <p class='p_narrow'>
              The user interface has been split into multiple tabs. Navagate between tabs by pressing the buttons
              at the top of the page. Navigate between documents by selecting the desired document at the top of this
              tab. To begin, select and follow the "Tutorial 1" document.
            </p>

            <p class='p_narrow'>
              Your first task will be to complete the NAND design. This will be easy because the NAND blueprint
              is free and you already have the NAND gate available as a primitive.
            </p>
            <p class='p_narrow'>
              You'll purchase the blueprint so it will be available for you to implement. Then you'll load up the NAND test fixture and run your
              first verification simulation. The test fixture is fully complete so you don't need to make
              any changes.

              Your second task will be to complete the NOT design. This time you will need money to purchase the
              blueprint and you'll need to design and implement the NOT gate.
            </p>
            <p class='p_narrow'>
              To get money, you will need to sell NANDs but you can't do that without first mining some silicon.
              To implement the NOT gate you'll probably want to refer to the primitives document and the netlist
              format document.
            </p>
            <div id='div_popout_tutorial_2' class='div_tutorial_popout' data-title='Tutorial 2'>
              <ol class='ol_narrow'>
                <li>Go to the Business tab to check the price of the NOT blueprint, the sale price of the NAND design, and the cost of the NAND design in Si.</li>
                <li>Go to the Si Mine tab and mine enough Si so you can sell enough NANDs to buy the NOT blueprint.</li>
                <li>Go to the Business tab, sell some NANDs and buy the NOT blueprint.</li>
                <li>Go to the Design tab.</li>
                <li>Select the NOT design.</li>
                <li>Read the design description.</li>
                <li>Press the Load Test button.</li>
                <li>Using the available primitives and valid netlist format (see other documents for references), implement your NOT design above the test fixture loaded in the previous step.
                    You're going to need to add text to the top of the netlist that looks something like this:
                  <div><div class='div_docs_netlist'>DEF NOT
  PORT IN A
  PORT OUT Z

  <span class='span_docs_comment'>#</span>

                </li>
                <li>Press the Init\Reset button.</li>
                <li>Press the Run button.</li>
                <li>Review the log messages and iterate over the previous 3 steps until you have successfully implemented a NOT gate</li>
              </ol>
              <button type='button' class='button_popout' title='Pop out' data-popout_div='div_popout_tutorial_2'>&#x21B7;</button>
            </div>
            <p class='p_narrow'>
              Now is probably a good time to start storing your designs into a local file that you can load into the simulator. This will
              not be the last time you will need a NOT gate. Create a new text file anywhere on your computer. Edit the file with your
              favorite text editor. You can use the Choose File and Prepend File buttons on the Design tab to load your designs directly
              from the file into the netlist textbox.
            </p>
            <p class='p_narrow'>
              You've finished all the tutorials. Try to purchase and implement all the remaining designs. You'll find upgrades available on the
              Upgrades tab that will help you along the way.
            </p>

              A netlist defines logical blocks, their hierarchy, and their connections. A logical block can contain
              input and output ports, internal nets, and child blocks. A block must be defined before it can be used.
              First a quick and dirty example to get you started and a detailed annotated example follows it.
            </p>
            <div><div class='div_docs_netlist'><span class='span_docs_comment'>#Create a new block called "SimpleBlock".</span>
<span class='span_docs_comment'>#It has input ports A and B and an output port Z.</span>

<span class='span_docs_comment'>#The NAND has 2 input ports and one output port.</span>
<span class='span_docs_comment'>#Connect the input ports A and B to the NAND's 2 input ports and</span>

ENDDEF</div></div>
            <p class='p_narrow'>
              This simple example can also be thought of in programming terms as something like the following:
            </p>
            <pre>
Function SimpleBlock (input A, input B) {
  return NAND(A, B);
}</pre>
            <p class='p_narrow'>
              Just remember that you can have multiple output ports.
            </p>

              Our NAND gates are semiconductors and are primarily made of silicon (Si). You will need
              silicon when you sell designs. You'll need more silicon to make more complex designs.
              You can collect silicon by 'mining' on the Mine tab. You can also purchase upgrades
              which will increase your mining efficiency or automatically mine for you.
